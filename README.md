### Demo

See the latest version at https://ewegithub.sb.karmalab.net/pages/EWE/CADMUS/

### Prerequisites

- npm, the node package manager, (only to install bower if you don't already have it).
- bower, a Node.js-based package manager used to install front-end packages (like Polymer).

### Getting started

To start developing, you need to:

1. Clone the repository
2. Checkout the `gh-pages` branch
3. Install dependencies using `bower install`
4. Start the server `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
5. Open `localhost:8000/dev.html` to load local assets

### Deployment

Any code pushed to the `gh-pages` branch will be deployed and visible at the demo URL above. Sometimes it takes a few minutes for the page to show pushed changes.
